HTML EDITS:
*I want there to be seperate pages for each league
*/js I want there to be an updating table with the top elo scores of the league at the bottom of every table

CSS EDITS:
*The page needs to be coherent, look good, and have a consistent color scheme.
*/html Potentially, a stylesheet should be designed.

JS EDITS
*The data should be inputed such that not only can I find out what the elo score was of Team X at the end of Y month, but also 
that I can find yearly elo scores (in 2013, a team's score was x, but in 2014 it was y)
*At the end of every year, the score must revert to the mean by 1/3
My notes say:
GENERAL SEASON SCORES -
general month function
-------month game array of objects
- import previous month(s) elo scores (thru object)
- contain induvidual games
- export an array of new elo scores
- those new scores add to object 
-

1) needs to know everyone's elo scores
2) work out new elo score based on game
3) work out elo probabilty
